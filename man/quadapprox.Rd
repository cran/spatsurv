\title{QuadApprox function}
\usage{
QuadApprox(fun, npts, argRanges, plot = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fun}{a function}

\item{npts}{integer number of points in each direction}

\item{argRanges}{a list of ranges on which to construct the grid for each parameter}

\item{plot}{whether to plot the quadratic approximation of the posterior (for two-dimensional parameters only)}

\item{...}{other arguments to be passed to fun}
}
\value{
a 2 by 2 matrix containing the curvature at the maximum and the (x,y) value at which the maximum occurs
}
\description{
A function to compute the second derivative of a function (of several real variables) using a quadratic approximation  on a
grid of points defined by the list argRanges. Also returns the local maximum.
