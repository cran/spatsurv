\usage{
plotsurv(spp, ss, maxcex = 1, transform = identity, background = NULL,
  eventpt = 19, eventcol = "red", censpt = "+", censcol = "black",
  xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, add = FALSE,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{spp}{A spatial points data frame}

\item{ss}{A Surv object (with right-censoring)}

\item{maxcex}{maximum size of dots default is equavalent to setting cex equal to 1}

\item{transform}{optional transformation to apply to the data, a function, for example 'sqrt'}

\item{background}{a background object to plot default is null, which gives a blamk background note that if non-null, the parameters xlim and ylim will be derived from this object.}

\item{eventpt}{The type of point to illustrate events, default is 19 (see ?pch)}

\item{eventcol}{the colour of events, default is black}

\item{censpt}{The type of point to illustrate events, default is "+" (see ?pch)}

\item{censcol}{the colour of censored observations, default is red}

\item{xlim}{optional x-limits of plot, default is to choose this automatically}

\item{ylim}{optional y-limits of plot, default is to choose this automatically}

\item{xlab}{label for x-axis}

\item{ylab}{label for y-axis}

\item{add}{logical, whether to add the survival plot on top of an existing plot, default is FALSE, which produces a plot in a new device}

\item{...}{other arguments to pass to plot}
}
\value{
Plots the survival data non-censored observations appear as dots and censored observations as crosses. The size of the dot is proportional to the observed time.
}
\description{
A function to produce a 2-D plot of right censored spatial survival data.
