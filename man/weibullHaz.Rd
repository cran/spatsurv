\description{
A function to define a parametric proportional hazards
model where the baseline hazard is taken from the Weibull
model. This function returns an object inheriting class
'basehazardspec', list of functions 'distinfo',
'basehazard', 'gradbasehazard', 'hessbasehazard',
'cumbasehazard', 'gradcumbasehazard', 'hesscumbasehazard'
and 'densityquantile'
}
\details{
The \code{distinfo} function is used to provide basic
distribution specific information to other \code{spatsurv}
functions. The user is required to provide the following
information in the returned list: \code{npars}, the number
of parameters in this distribution; \code{parnames}, the
names of the parameters; \code{trans}, the transformation
scale on which the priors will be provided; \code{itrans},
the inverse transformation function that will be applied to
the parameters before the hazard, and other functions are
evaluated; \code{jacobian}, the derivative of the inverse
transformation function with respect to each of the
parameters; and \code{hessian}, the second derivatives of
the inverse transformation function with respect to each of
the parameters -- note that currently the package
\code{spatsurv} only allows the use of functions where the
parameters are transformed independently.

The \code{basehazard} function is used to evaluate the
baseline hazard function for the distribution of interest.
It returns a function that accepts as input a vector of
times, \code{t} and returns a vector.

The \code{gradbasehazard} function is used to evaluate the
gradient of the baseline hazard function with respect to
the parameters, this typically returns a vector. It returns
a function that accepts as input a vector of times,
\code{t}, and returns a matrix.

The \code{hessbasehazard} function is used to evaluate the
Hessian of the baseline hazard function. It returns a
function that accepts as input a vector of times, \code{t}
and returns a list of hessian matrices corresponding to
each \code{t}.

The \code{cumbasehazard} function is used to evaluate the
cumulative baseline hazard function for the distribution of
interest. It returns a function that accepts as input a
vector of times, \code{t} and returns a vector.

The \code{gradcumbasehazard} function is used to evaluate
the gradient of the cumulative baseline hazard function
with respect to the parameters, this typically returns a
vector. It returns a function that accepts as input a
vector of times, \code{t}, and returns a matrix.

The \code{hesscumbasehazard} function is used to evaluate
the Hessian of the cumulative baseline hazard function. It
returns a function that accepts as input a vector of times,
\code{t} and returns a list of hessian matrices
corresponding to each \code{t}.

The \code{densityquantile} function is used to return
quantiles of the density function. This is NOT REQUIRED for
running the MCMC, merely for us in post-processing with the
\code{predict} function where \code{type} is
'densityquantile'. In the case of the Weibull model for the
baseline hazard, it can be shown that the q-th quantile is:
